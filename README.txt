SMatrAnEM has been released for testing on various systems.
Sorry, any pull request will not be accepted, since SMatrAnEM could change significantly by the end of 2020.
Comments or suggestions are welcome.

This 'README.txt' explains SMatrAnEM shortly.
Scattering Matrix Analyzer (SMatrAn) can generate the scattering matrix (S-matrix) of 3D scatterers.
In particular, SMatrAnEM focuses on electromagnetic wave scattering.

The generated S-matrix maintains higher quarity, because SMatrAnEM uses both numerical mesher of orthogonal curvilinear coordinates and stable S-matrix-solver with accurate mode-solver.
See 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.06574' to understand formulae in SMatrAnEM that is independently developed by Tatsuya Usuki.
SMatrAnEM also involves FDTD solver for analyzing larger structure.

This directory contains 4 shell scripts, 13 executable files (after compiling codes), 13+4 directories, 4 input files, 'LICENSE.txt', and this 'README.txt'.

Shell scripts:
	file name    	discription	
	./comp_all.sh	It generates all executable files.
	./make_all.sh	It updates executable files.
	./act_exe.sh 	It activates all executable files.
	./run_all.sh 	It runs all executable files for an example. See figure './LatexDoc/run_all.pdf'.

Executable files (generated by './comp_all.sh' or './make_all.sh'):
	file name 	directory of source files and 'Readme.txt'	
	./xi2u    	./NonUniform/

	./SliceData/	Cross-section data generated by './YeeSlice'
	( ./.git/   	Hidden directory contains git information. )

Input files (See comments in each file to know its format.):
	file name      	discription	
	./input.txt    	All exe-files read it. See './run_all.sh'.
	./3d_str.txt   	It discribes 3D-structures for scatterer and waveguides.
	./trans_med.txt	It links medium parameters and the 3D-structures.
	./PML_str.txt  	It sets perfectly matched layers into the 3D-space.
